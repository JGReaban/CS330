# CS330
Project for SNHU Class 330 - Computer Visualization
Jeremy Reaban

Essentially I just designed this project one object and aspect at a time, slowly adding and improving things as I learned
more about OpenGL First objects, then camera controls, then textures, finally lighting, then more objects

What I learned is somewhat outdated, since OpenGL has been deprecated in favor of Vulkan, but the basic principles seem to
be the same. So it will be helpful in understand how graphics work in other applications. And understanding how graphics work
will help in later classes here that focus on developing apps for mobile and the web.
